/**
 * In ES6 modules are built into the language.
 * Traceur (google tool): a compiler that takes ES6
 * (including classes, generators, destructuring and
 * much more) and compiles it down to regular ES5 js
 * that runs in your browser.
 * SystemJS: a module loader that can import modules at 
 * run time (load modules after code has been compiled).
