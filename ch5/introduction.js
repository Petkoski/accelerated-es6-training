/**
 * Iterators - all objects that know how to access values
 * in a collection (one at a time). Example - an array, its
 * iterable (means you can loop through it), it has collection
 * of objects and knows how to output them one after another.
 * 
 * You can also create own objects with own iterable logic.

/**
 * Generator - closely related to that ^, but it is a function 
 * which doesn't necessarily runs to the end when executed. A
 * function that yields certain values. Each time you call it,
 * yields the next value.
 */

//These two used together is a powerful combination.
