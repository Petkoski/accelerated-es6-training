/**
 * Promise - a useful object helper to work with async tasks.
 * They give us a promise that they will give us back some 
 * data (at some point in future). We know that we'll get back
 * data, so can continue with the code and specify a 
 * function on our promise to do something with the data
 * when we get it back.
 * 
 * Allow us to escape callback hell.
